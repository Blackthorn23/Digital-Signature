# Digital-Signature

Digital Signature System
This project implements a Digital Signature System using RSA cryptography to ensure data authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation. The system provides a secure way to sign and verify digital files using SHA-256 hashing and RSA key pairs.

Features
âœ” Role-Based Access â€“ Admins generate keys & sign files, while Clients verify signatures.
âœ” Secure Hashing â€“ Uses SHA-256 to generate file hashes.
âœ” Digital Signature â€“ RSA private key signs hashed files.
âœ” Signature Verification â€“ Clients verify authenticity using the RSA public key.
âœ” Graphical User Interface (GUI) â€“ Built using Java Swing for an interactive experience.

Usage
Login â€“ Admin (admin/admin123) or Client (client/client123).
Generate Keys â€“ Admin generates RSA public & private keys.
Hash a File â€“ Admin creates a SHA-256 hash of a selected file.
Sign a File â€“ Admin signs the hash using the private key.
Verify a Signature â€“ Clients verify file integrity using the signature & public key.
Setup

Security Notes
âš  Never share private_key.txt â€“ it must remain confidential.
âš  Ensure public_key.txt is distributed securely to clients.

This project was developed as part of the Applied Cryptography (TAC6223) course. ðŸš€
